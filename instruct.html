      <h4>Giap Nguyen</h4>
      <p> Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having
          competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, and  started Straight to
          the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery eduction options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger
          Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young
          women, and the business has been booming ever since.
